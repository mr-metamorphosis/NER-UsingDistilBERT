### Named Entity Recognition (NER) with Hugging Face Transformers

This repository provides an example of how to fine-tune a pre-trained Transformer model for Named Entity Recognition (NER) using the Hugging Face Transformers library. The dataset used in this example is the CoNLL-2003 dataset, which includes annotations for four types of entities: Person, Organization, Location, and Miscellaneous.

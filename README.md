# Named Entity Recognition (NER) with Hugging Face Transformers

This repository provides an example of how to fine-tune a pre-trained Transformer model for Named Entity Recognition (NER) using the Hugging Face Transformers library. The dataset used in this example is the CoNLL-2003 dataset, which includes annotations for four types of entities: Person, Organization, Location, and Miscellaneous.

## Installation

To get started, you need to install the required libraries:

```bash
!pip install -U transformers
!pip install -U accelerate
!pip install -U datasets
!pip install seqeval
!pip install evaluate
```

## Dataset Overview

The CoNLL-2003 dataset is used in this example. It is a standard dataset for NER tasks, containing the following entity types:

- **PER**: Person
- **ORG**: Organization
- **LOC**: Location
- **MISC**: Miscellaneous

The dataset is available in the `datasets` library and can be loaded easily with the following command:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

data = load_dataset('conllpp')
```

## Code Explanation

### Data Preparation

1. **Load and Explore the Dataset**: 
    ```python
    data = load_dataset('conllpp')
    ```

2. **Inspect the Dataset Structure**:
    ```python
    data['train'].features
    ```

3. **Convert NER Tags to Human-Readable Format**:
    - Define mapping from tag indices to tag names and vice versa.
    ```python
    tags = data['train'].features['ner_tags'].feature

    index2tag = {idx:tag for idx, tag in enumerate(tags.names)}
    tag2index = {tag:idx for idx, tag in enumerate(tags.names)}
    ```

4. **Add Readable NER Tag Names**:
    - Create a new column with human-readable NER tag names.
    ```python
    def create_tag_names(batch):
        tag_name = {'ner_tags_str': [tags.int2str(idx) for idx in batch['ner_tags']]}
        return tag_name

    data = data.map(create_tag_names)
    ```

### Model Building

1. **Tokenization**:
    - Tokenize the input text using a pre-trained DistilBERT tokenizer.
    ```python
    from transformers import AutoTokenizer

    model_checkpoint = "distilbert-base-cased"
    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_checkpoint)
    ```

2. **Align Labels with Tokens**:
    - Align the NER labels with the tokenized input.
    ```python
    def align_labels_with_tokens(labels, word_ids):
        new_labels = []
        current_word = None
        for word_id in word_ids:
            if word_id != current_word:
                current_word = word_id
                label = -100 if word_id is None else labels[word_id]
                new_labels.append(label)

            elif word_id is None:
                new_labels.append(-100)

            else:
                label = labels[word_id]

                if label % 2 == 1:
                    label = label + 1
                new_labels.append(label)

        return new_labels
    ```

3. **Tokenize and Align Labels**:
    - Tokenize the dataset and align labels using the function defined above.
    ```python
    def tokenize_and_align_labels(examples):
        tokenized_inputs = tokenizer(examples['tokens'], truncation=True, is_split_into_words=True)

        all_labels = examples['ner_tags']

        new_labels = []
        for i, labels in enumerate(all_labels):
            word_ids = tokenized_inputs.word_ids(i)
            new_labels.append(align_labels_with_tokens(labels, word_ids))

        tokenized_inputs['labels'] = new_labels

        return tokenized_inputs

    tokenized_datasets = data.map(tokenize_and_align_labels, batched=True, remove_columns=data['train'].column_names)
    ```

### Data Collation and Metrics

1. **Data Collation**:
    - Use a data collator for token classification to handle padding and batching.
    ```python
    from transformers import DataCollatorForTokenClassification

    data_collator = DataCollatorForTokenClassification(tokenizer=tokenizer)
    ```

2. **Define Evaluation Metrics**:
    - Use the `seqeval` library for evaluation.
    ```python
    import evaluate

    metric = evaluate.load('seqeval')

    label_names = data['train'].features['ner_tags'].feature.names
    ```

3. **Compute Evaluation Metrics**:
    - Compute precision, recall, F1, and accuracy.
    ```python
    import numpy as np

    def compute_metrics(eval_preds):
        logits, labels = eval_preds

        predictions = np.argmax(logits, axis=-1)

        true_labels = [[label_names[l] for l in label if l != -100] for label in labels]

        true_predictions = [[label_names[p] for p, l in zip(prediction, label) if l != -100]
                            for prediction, label in zip(predictions, labels)]

        all_metrics = metric.compute(predictions=true_predictions, references=true_labels)

        return {"precision": all_metrics['overall_precision'],
                "recall": all_metrics['overall_recall'],
                "f1": all_metrics['overall_f1'],
                "accuracy": all_metrics['overall_accuracy']}
    ```

## Model Training

1. **Model Configuration**:
    - Define the ID-to-label and label-to-ID mappings.
    ```python
    id2label = {i: label for i, label in enumerate(label_names)}
    label2id = {label: i for i, label in enumerate(label_names)}
    ```

2. **Initialize Model**:
    - Load a pre-trained DistilBERT model for token classification.
    ```python
    from transformers import AutoModelForTokenClassification

    model = AutoModelForTokenClassification.from_pretrained(
        model_checkpoint,
        id2label=id2label,
        label2id=label2id
    )
    ```

3. **Set Training Arguments**:
    - Define training arguments, including learning rate, epochs, and evaluation strategy.
    ```python
    from transformers import TrainingArguments

    args = TrainingArguments(
        "distilbert-finetuned-ner",
        evaluation_strategy="epoch",
        save_strategy="epoch",
        learning_rate=2e-5,
        num_train_epochs=10,
        weight_decay=0.01
    )
    ```

4. **Train the Model**:
    - Use the `Trainer` class for model training.
    ```python
    from transformers import Trainer

    trainer = Trainer(
        model=model,
        args=args,
        train_dataset=tokenized_datasets['train'],
        eval_dataset=tokenized_datasets['validation'],
        data_collator=data_collator,
        compute_metrics=compute_metrics,
        tokenizer=tokenizer
    )

    trainer.train()
    ```

## Evaluation and Results

1. **Evaluate Model Performance**:
    - Use the trained model to make predictions and evaluate performance using the `seqeval` metric.
    ```python
    from transformers import pipeline

    checkpoint = "/content/distilbert-finetuned-ner/checkpoint-5268"
    token_classifier = pipeline(
        "token-classification", model=checkpoint, aggregation_strategy="simple"
    )

    results = token_classifier('''On July 15, 2024, Dr. Emily Johnson, a renowned cardiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts,
                        announced a groundbreaking discovery in the treatment of heart disease.
                        The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and conducted in collaboration with Stanford University.
                        Dr. Johnson's team included experts from around the world, such as Professor Hiroshi Tanaka from the University of Tokyo
                        and Dr. Maria Gonzales from the University of SÃ£o Paulo. The study, published in the Journal of Cardiology,
                        showed promising results in reducing the risk of heart attacks by 30% using a new drug called CardioX.
                        This development has drawn significant attention from pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer and Merck,
                        who are keen on exploring potential partnerships.
                        The next phase of the clinical trials will commence in September 2024, with over 1,000 participants across three countries:
                        the United States, Japan, and Brazil.''')
    ```

2. **Export Model Checkpoints**:
    - Save the model checkpoints for future use.
    ```bash
    !zip -r distilbert_ner.zip "/content/distilbert-finetuned-ner/checkpoint-5268"
    ```

## Usage

To use the trained model for NER tasks, you can run the token classification pipeline as shown in the Evaluation and Results section. The pipeline will output recognized entities with their corresponding labels.
